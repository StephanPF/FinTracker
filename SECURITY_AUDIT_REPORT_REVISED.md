**Project:** Accounting System Prototype (Personal Use)  
**Location:** C:\Users\steph\OneDrive - Planfocus Consulting\Projects\Accounting System Prototype\accounting-app  
**Context:** Personal accounting application with local data storage on user's computer

---

## Executive Summary

This security audit examined the personal accounting application codebase across six critical areas: Data Validation & Integrity, Security Issues, Error Handling, Code Quality, Business Logic, and Database Operations. **Important Note:** This is a personal-use application with local data storage, which significantly changes the risk assessment compared to web-based or multi-user applications.

### Key Findings Summary:
- **Critical Issues:** 1 finding requiring immediate remediation (revised)
- **High Risk Issues:** 4 findings requiring urgent attention (revised)
- **Medium Risk Issues:** 8 findings requiring prompt attention (revised)
- **Low Risk Issues:** 10 informational findings (revised)
- **Non-Issues:** 5 findings not applicable to personal-use context

### Overall Security Rating: **LOW-MEDIUM RISK** (Revised for Personal Use Context)

---

## Personal Use Context Impact

**Important:** This audit has been revised to reflect that this is a **personal accounting application** with **local data storage** on the user's computer. This context significantly changes the risk assessment:

### Risks That Don't Apply:
- ❌ **Network-based attacks** (no network communication for core functionality)
- ❌ **Multi-user access control** (single user application)
- ❌ **Authentication bypass** (no authentication needed)
- ❌ **Malicious user input** (user is not trying to attack themselves)
- ❌ **Server-side security** (no server component)

### Risks That Still Apply:
- ✅ **Data integrity** from browser crashes or JavaScript errors
- ✅ **API credential exposure** if computer is compromised
- ✅ **Accidental data corruption** through user error
- ✅ **Financial calculation accuracy** for personal records

### Personal Use Security Model:
The primary security boundary is **physical access to the computer**. If someone has access to your computer, they likely have access to far more than just your accounting application. The security focus should be on **data integrity** and **preventing accidental self-inflicted data loss**.

## Detailed Findings by Category

### 1. Data Validation & Integrity

#### LOW - Client-Side Only Validation (Revised Assessment)
**Risk Level:** Low (Personal Use Context)  
**Files:** All form components and database operations  
**Description:** The application relies entirely on client-side validation, which is appropriate for personal-use applications but could lead to self-inflicted data corruption.

**Evidence:**
- `TransactionForm.jsx` lines 342-421: All validation is performed in the browser
- `BankConfigurationForm.jsx` lines 186-212: Form validation occurs only on the client
- No server-side validation layer (not needed for local personal use)

**Impact in Personal Use Context:** 
- Risk of accidental data corruption through developer tools (user error)
- JavaScript errors could bypass validation temporarily
- No risk from malicious users (single-user application)
- No network-based injection attacks (local data only)

**Recommendation for Personal Use:** 
- Strengthen client-side validation with better error messages
- Add data backup mechanisms before critical operations
- Implement local transaction rollback for failed operations
- **Note:** Server-side validation is unnecessary overhead for personal use

#### MEDIUM - Input Sanitization for XSS Prevention
**Risk Level:** Medium (Personal Use Context)  
**Files:** `TransactionForm.jsx`, `BankConfigurationForm.jsx`, `DataManagement.jsx`  
**Lines:** Various input fields throughout forms

**Description:** User inputs are not sanitized, creating potential issues if data is exported or shared.

**Impact (Personal Use):**
- Risk when exporting data to external systems
- Potential issues if sharing data files with others
- JavaScript errors if special characters cause parsing issues

**Recommendation for Personal Use:**
- Add basic input sanitization for special characters
- Validate inputs that could break CSV exports or file formats
- Focus on data integrity rather than security exploits

#### HIGH - Dangerous dangerouslySetInnerHTML Usage
**Risk Level:** High (Applies to personal use)  
**Files:** `NumberFormatSettings.jsx`  
**Lines:** 1 occurrence found

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// NumberFormatSettings.jsx
<span className="preview-value" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: preview.negative?.USD || 'Loading...' }}></span>
```

**Impact:** Risk of self-inflicted XSS if preview data contains scripts
**Recommendation:** Remove dangerouslySetInnerHTML and use safe text rendering instead.

### 2. Security Issues

#### CRITICAL - Credentials Stored in Plain Text
**Risk Level:** Critical (Unchanged - applies to personal use)  
**Files:** `relationalDatabase.js`, `CurrencyManager.jsx`  
**Lines:** Schema definition and settings

**Description:** API keys for external services (exchange rates) are stored in plain text, creating risk even in personal use context.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// relationalDatabase.js line 46
api_settings: ['id', 'provider', 'apiKey', 'baseUrl', 'isActive', 'createdAt', 'updatedAt']
```

**Impact (Personal Use):** 
- API credentials exposure if computer is compromised
- Potential unauthorized charges to your API accounts
- Risk if sharing data files with others

**Recommendation for Personal Use:** 
- Store API keys in environment variables or secure local storage
- Encrypt sensitive credentials in local database
- Consider using free API tiers that don't require sensitive keys

#### NON-ISSUE - No Authentication/Authorization Framework
**Risk Level:** Not Applicable (Personal Use Context)  
**Files:** Entire application  
**Description:** The application is designed for personal use on the user's own computer, making authentication unnecessary.

**Personal Use Context:**
- Single user application on personal computer
- Physical access control is the security boundary
- No network access or multi-user concerns
- User has full administrative access to their own computer anyway

**Impact (Personal Use):** None - this is by design and appropriate

**Recommendation for Personal Use:** 
- **No authentication needed** - would add unnecessary complexity
- Focus on data backup and recovery instead
- Consider file-level encryption if computer is shared or portable

#### MEDIUM - External API Call Security (Revised)
**Risk Level:** Medium (Personal Use Context)  
**Files:** `liveExchangeRateService.js`  
**Lines:** 29-100

**Description:** External API calls lack some security measures, but risk is lower in personal use context.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// Simple fetch without custom headers to avoid CORS preflight
let response = await fetch(url);
```

**Impact (Personal Use Context):** 
- Risk of receiving corrupted exchange rate data
- Potential API rate limiting issues
- Lower risk of man-in-the-middle attacks on personal network
- No multi-user API abuse concerns

**Recommendation for Personal Use:**
- Add response validation and sanitization
- Implement timeout controls to prevent hanging
- Add error handling for API failures
- **Note:** Complex security headers less critical for personal use

### 3. Error Handling

#### MEDIUM - Inconsistent Error Handling Patterns
**Risk Level:** Medium (Personal Use Context)  
**Files:** Multiple files throughout the application

**Description:** Error handling is inconsistent, which could lead to confusing user experience during data operations.

#### MEDIUM - Type Validation for Financial Data
**Risk Level:** Medium (Personal Use Context)  
**Files:** Form components and database operations

**Description:** Financial calculations lack comprehensive type validation.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
amount: parseFloat(transactionData.amount), // No validation if parseFloat fails
exchangeRate: parseFloat(transactionData.exchangeRate) || 1.0,
```

**Impact (Personal Use):**
- Risk of corrupting your own financial calculations
- Potential data integrity issues in personal records
- Difficulty tracking down calculation errors

**Recommendation for Personal Use:**
- Add robust validation for all financial inputs
- Implement range checking for reasonable values
- Add warnings for unusual amounts or rates

### 5. Business Logic

#### HIGH - Currency Conversion Data Integrity
**Risk Level:** High (Personal Use Context)  
**Files:** `exchangeRateService.js`, `budgetCalculations.js`

**Description:** Currency conversion logic lacks comprehensive validation for personal financial accuracy.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
convertAmount(amount, fromCurrencyId, toCurrencyId, date = null) {
  const rate = this.getExchangeRate(fromCurrencyId, toCurrencyId, date);
  if (rate === null) {
    throw new Error(`Exchange rate not found`);
  }
  return amount * rate; // No validation of amount or rate values
}
```

**Impact (Personal Use):**
- Inaccurate personal financial calculations
- Potential errors in budget tracking
- Risk of making financial decisions on incorrect data

**Recommendation for Personal Use:**
- Add comprehensive validation for financial calculations

### 6. Database Operations

#### HIGH - No Transaction Management (Unchanged - Critical for Data Integrity)
**Risk Level:** High (Applies to personal use)  
**Files:** `relationalDatabase.js`

**Description:** Database operations lack proper transaction management, creating data consistency risks that affect personal financial data integrity.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// Multiple operations without transaction boundaries
this.tables.transactions.splice(transactionIndex, 1);
// Re-find the linked transaction index after first deletion
const updatedLinkedIndex = this.tables.transactions.findIndex(/*...*/);
```

**Impact (Personal Use):**
- Risk of corrupting your own financial data during browser crashes
- Potential loss of transaction relationships
- No rollback if complex operations fail partway through

**Recommendation for Personal Use:**
- Implement local transaction boundaries with snapshots
- Add automatic backup before major operations
- Ensure atomic operations for related changes
- **Note:** This is critical even for personal use to protect your financial data

#### MEDIUM - Deletion Safeguards Present but Could Be Enhanced
**Risk Level:** Medium (Personal Use Context)  
**Files:** `relationalDatabase.js` lines 1336-1405

**Description:** Good deletion safeguards exist but could be more comprehensive for personal data protection.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// Account deletion check
const usedInTransactions = this.tables.transactions.some(
  transaction => transaction.accountId === id || transaction.destinationAccountId === id
);
if (usedInTransactions) {
  throw new Error('Cannot delete account: it is used in transactions');
}
```

**Positive:** Good referential integrity checking protects your personal financial data
**Recommendation for Personal Use:** Continue enhancing safeguards to prevent accidental data loss
