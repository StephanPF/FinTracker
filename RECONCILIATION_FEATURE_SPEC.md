# Bank Statement Reconciliation Feature Specification

## Overview
Monthly bank statement reconciliation feature that allows users to match manually entered transactions with bank statement entries by flagging transactions with reconciliation reference numbers.

## User Experience Flow

### Step 1: Reconciliation Setup
- User navigates to dedicated Reconciliation page
- Enter reconciliation reference label (e.g., "R0125" for January 2025)
- Enter total amount from bank statement for comparison

### Step 2: Transaction Selection & Reconciliation
- Filter transactions using same UI as Transaction Listing page
- Tick/select transactions to mark as reconciled
- Each selected transaction gets reconciliation reference stored in database
- Running total updates in real-time as transactions are selected
- Shows difference between running total vs. bank statement total
- User can compare amounts at any time during the process

## Key Requirements

### Database Requirements
- **Reconciliation reference must be stored against transaction records**
- Add `reconciliationReference` field to transactions table
- Add `reconciledAt` timestamp field for audit trail
- Update database schema and validation rules

### Functional Requirements
- Real-time total calculation and difference display
- Reuse existing Transaction Listing UI and filtering components
- Support for multiple reconciliation sessions (different reference numbers)
- Ability to view previously reconciled transactions
- Clear visual indication of reconciled vs. unreconciled transactions

## High-Level Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Updates
```javascript
// Add to transaction schema
{
  reconciliationReference: String, // e.g., "R0125"
  reconciledAt: Date,             // Timestamp when reconciled
  // ... existing fields
}
```

### 2. Backend/Context Functions
```javascript
// Add to AccountingContext
- getUnreconciledTransactions()
- getReconciledTransactions(reference)
- reconcileTransaction(id, reference)
- unreconcileTransaction(id)
- getReconciliationSummary(reference)
```

### 3. Component Architecture
```
ReconciliationPage.jsx (Main container)
├── ReconciliationSetup.jsx (Step 1)
│   ├── Reference input field
│   ├── Bank statement total input
│   └── Start reconciliation button
├── ReconciliationSummary.jsx (Always visible during reconciliation)
│   ├── Current reconciliation reference
│   ├── Selected transactions total
│   ├── Bank statement total
│   ├── Difference calculation (+/-)
│   └── Progress indicator
└── ReconciliationTransactionList.jsx (Step 2)
    ├── Transaction filters (reuse from TransactionList)
    ├── Transaction table with checkboxes
    ├── Real-time selection updates
    └── Bulk selection controls
```

### 4. State Management
```javascript
// Reconciliation state
{
  reconciliationReference: String,
  bankStatementTotal: Number,
  selectedTransactions: Array,
  runningTotal: Number,
  difference: Number,
  isActive: Boolean,
  filters: Object
}
```

### 5. UI/UX Features
- **Visual Indicators**: Different styling for reconciled vs. unreconciled transactions
- **Real-time Updates**: Totals and differences update immediately on selection
- **Filter Inheritance**: Use same filtering logic as Transaction Listing page
- **Progress Tracking**: Show how many transactions selected and remaining difference
- **Validation**: Warn if difference is not zero before completing reconciliation

### 6. Navigation & Routing
- Add `/reconciliation` route to application router
- Add "Reconciliation" menu item to main navigation
- Breadcrumb navigation within reconciliation workflow

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database & Backend
1. Update transaction schema with reconciliation fields
2. Add reconciliation functions to AccountingContext
3. Update database migration/initialization scripts

### Phase 2: Core UI Components  
1. Create ReconciliationPage main container
2. Build ReconciliationSetup component
3. Create ReconciliationSummary component
4. Build ReconciliationTransactionList (reuse TransactionList logic)

### Phase 3: Integration & Features
1. Add routing and navigation
2. Implement real-time total calculations
3. Add filtering and search capabilities
4. Create reconciliation history/reports

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing
1. Add visual indicators and styling
2. Implement validation and error handling
3. Add bulk operations (select all, clear all)
4. Test reconciliation workflow end-to-end

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully reconcile monthly bank statements
- Reconciliation references are permanently stored in database
- Real-time totals match user expectations
- UI is intuitive and reuses familiar patterns
- Zero data loss during reconciliation process
- Audit trail available for compliance/review

## Technical Notes
- Reuse existing TransactionList filtering and display logic
- Ensure reconciliation references are indexed for performance
- Consider adding reconciliation reports/export functionality
- Maintain transaction data integrity during reconciliation updates
