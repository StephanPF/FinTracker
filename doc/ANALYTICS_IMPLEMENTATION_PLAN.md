# Analytics Section Implementation Plan

# Analytics Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Analytics module provides comprehensive financial insights through two main views: **Cashflow View** and **Expense View**. This implementation integrates with the existing budget system to provide budget vs actual analysis, goal tracking, and spending pattern insights.

## Integration with Budget System

### Budget Data Access
- **Active Budget**: Analytics automatically uses the single active budget for comparisons
- **Budget Line Items**: Expense subcategories with defined budget amounts and periods
- **Period Normalization**: Convert budget periods (weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly) to match analytics view timeframe
- **Budget Status**: Only active budgets are used for budget vs actual analysis

### Budget Integration Points
```javascript
// Budget data structure from existing system
const activeBudget = {
  id: 'BUDGET_123456789',
  name: 'Monthly Household Budget',
  status: 'active',
  lineItems: [
    {
      subcategoryId: 'SUB_001',
      subcategoryName: 'Groceries',
      period: 'weekly',
      amount: 150.00
    }
  ]
};

// Normalization function for analytics
const normalizeBudgetToViewPeriod = (budgetAmount, budgetPeriod, viewPeriod) => {
  // Convert to monthly first
  const monthlyAmount = normalizeToMonthly(budgetAmount, budgetPeriod);
  
  // Then convert to view period
  switch (viewPeriod) {
    case 'monthly': return monthlyAmount;
    case 'quarterly': return monthlyAmount * 3;
    case 'yearly': return monthlyAmount * 12;
    default: return monthlyAmount;
  }
};
```

## Core Analytics Views

## Data Integration Layer

### Budget Data Fetching
```javascript
const getBudgetDataForAnalytics = async (selectedPeriod) => {
  // Get active budget
  const activeBudget = await getActiveBudget();
  if (!activeBudget) return null;
  
  // Normalize budget amounts to selected period
  const normalizedBudget = activeBudget.lineItems.map(item => ({
    ...item,
    normalizedAmount: normalizeBudgetToViewPeriod(item.amount, item.period, selectedPeriod),
    originalAmount: item.amount,
    originalPeriod: item.period
  }));
  
  return {
    ...activeBudget,
    lineItems: normalizedBudget,
    totalBudget: normalizedBudget.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.normalizedAmount, 0)
  };
};
```

### Transaction Data with Budget Context
```javascript
const getTransactionDataWithBudget = async (selectedPeriod, viewType) => {
  const transactions = await getTransactionsForPeriod(selectedPeriod, viewType);
  const budgetData = await getBudgetDataForAnalytics(selectedPeriod);
  
  // Group transactions by subcategory
  const subcategoryTotals = transactions.reduce((acc, transaction) => {
    const subcategoryId = transaction.subcategoryId;
    acc[subcategoryId] = (acc[subcategoryId] || 0) + transaction.amount;
    return acc;
  }, {});
  
  // Add budget context to each subcategory
  const subcategoriesWithBudget = Object.entries(subcategoryTotals).map(([subcategoryId, actualSpent]) => {
    const budgetItem = budgetData?.lineItems.find(item => item.subcategoryId === subcategoryId);
    
    return {
      subcategoryId,
      actualSpent,
      budgetAmount: budgetItem?.normalizedAmount || 0,
      hasBudget: !!budgetItem,
      variance: actualSpent - (budgetItem?.normalizedAmount || 0),
      variancePercentage: budgetItem ? (actualSpent / budgetItem.normalizedAmount) * 100 : null
    };
  });
  
  return subcategoriesWithBudget;
};
```

## Budget-Specific Analytics Features

### Budget Compliance Dashboard

- **Variance Analysis**: Biggest over/under budget items
- **Trend Analysis**: Improving or declining budget adherence over time
- **Category Risk Assessment**: Which categories are trending toward budget overruns

### Smart Insights Engine
```javascript
const generateBudgetInsights = (transactionData, budgetData) => {
  const insights = [];
  
  // Over-budget categories
  const overBudgetCategories = transactionData.filter(cat => cat.variance > 0);
  if (overBudgetCategories.length > 0) {
    insights.push({
      type: 'warning',
      title: 'Categories Over Budget',
      description: `${overBudgetCategories.length} categories exceeded budget this period`,
      action: 'Review spending in these areas',
      categories: overBudgetCategories.map(cat => cat.subcategoryId)
    });
  }
  
  // Significant savings
  const significantSavings = transactionData.filter(cat => 
    cat.hasBudget && cat.variance < -100 && cat.variancePercentage < 70
  );
  if (significantSavings.length > 0) {
    insights.push({
      type: 'success',
      title: 'Budget Savings Opportunities',
      description: 'You have significant unused budget in some categories',
      action: 'Consider reallocating budget or adjusting targets',
      categories: significantSavings.map(cat => cat.subcategoryId)
    });
  }
  
  // Budget adherence trends

### Data Requirements

#### Data Filtering Rules
**IMPORTANT**: Both views must apply these filters:

**Transaction Type Filtering:**
- **INCLUDE ONLY**: 
  - `CAT_001` (Income transactions)
  - `CAT_002` (Expense transactions)
- **EXCLUDE** from analytics:
  - `CAT_003` (Transfer transactions) 
  - `CAT_004` (Investment - SELL transactions)
  - `CAT_005` (Investment - BUY transactions)

**Account Type Filtering:**
- **INCLUDE ONLY** transactions from accounts with these account type IDs:
  - `ACCT_TYPE_001` (Asset - Bank Account)
  - `ACCT_TYPE_006` (Liability - Current Liability)
- **EXCLUDE** transactions from other account types:
  - `ACCT_TYPE_002` (Asset - Investment account)
  - `ACCT_TYPE_003` (Asset - Fixed Assets)
  - `ACCT_TYPE_004` (Asset - Retirement account)
  - `ACCT_TYPE_005` (Asset - Business account)
  - `ACCT_TYPE_007` (Liability - Long-term Liability)

#### For Expense View
- Transaction data filtered by:
  - Date range and accounts
  - **Transaction type ID = 'CAT_002' (Expenses only)**
- Budget data (if available) for comparison
- Category aggregations and breakdowns
- Prepaid expense tracking for accrual view
- Historical data for trend analysis

#### For Cashflow View  
- Transaction flows filtered by:
  - **Income: Transaction type ID = 'CAT_001'**
  - **Expenses: Transaction type ID = 'CAT_002'**
- Account balance changes over time (from CAT_001 and CAT_002 only)
- Daily transaction aggregations for calendar
- Recurring transaction identification
- Waterfall chart data preparation

### State Management
- Shared filter states (date range, account selection, view mode)
- Chart interaction states (selected categories, drill-downs)
- Loading states for data fetching
- Error handling for failed data loads

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with responsive grid
- Collapsible widgets on smaller screens
- Touch-friendly chart interactions

- Use existing currency formatting services

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Load budget data only when needed
- **Memoization**: Cache period normalization calculations
